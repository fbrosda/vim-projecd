*projecd.txt* *projecd*  Maintain a list of projects and cd to them.

Easy navigation between multiple projects. This plugin maintains a list list of
projects in a simple text file and offers a custom 'cd' command to choose one
from this list.

Projects are identified either by a vcs system (the default is git) or can be
added manually with |:ProjeCd|.


COMMANDS                                                *projecd-commands*

                                                        *projecd-:C*
:ProjeCd        Change the current directory, with tab completion from the
                saved projects. If |fzf| is installed it will be used to
                filter the results.

                                                        *projecd-:ProjeCd*
:ProjeCdAdd     A replacement for |:cd|, which adds the target directory to
                the list of projects. Useful either to add directory not under
                version control, or if |g:projecd_autosave| is disabled.


CONFIGURATION                                           *projecd-configuration*

*g:projecd_dbfile*

The path to the project list file. The file contains the absolute paths to each
project, separated by new lines.

Default: <plugin-base-dir>/.data/projecd_list


*g:projecd_rootcmd*

The command to identify the project root, for a given file. '{}' is replaced
with the path to the file visible in the current buffer.

Currently only one vcs system at a time is supported.

Default: 'git -C {} rev-parse --show-toplevel'


*g:projecd_autosave*

If enabled, the plugin automatically searches for the project root on |BufRead|.

Default: 1
